# This is intentionally blank as this sandbox is used as a path with sensible
# flow defaults (not those of the language server project) to provide
# diagnostics and completion to anonymous buffers that are provided to the
# server.

# The dummy.js file serves as the "path" for the buffer, but is never written
# to, instead flow is told the "new contents" of the file are the buffer
# contents
